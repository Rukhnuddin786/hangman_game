# hangman_game
This is a simple Hangman game built using Python for the command-line interface. The game randomly selects a word from a list of tricky and fun words. The player has to guess the word one letter at a time with only 6 chances (lives). For each wrong guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.



Features:

Random word selection from a predefined list of challenging words.
Visual hangman stages drawn using ASCII art.
Tracks letters guessed and prevents repeated guesses.
Ends with a win or loss message based on performance.



How to Play:

Run the script.
Enter one letter per turn to guess the hidden word.
You have 6 lives. Use them wisely!
Win the game by guessing all the letters before the hangman is fully drawn.
